## This is a game that you need to complete

Please describe the rules in this list:
1. The hero battles the dragon until the hp of the dragon is smaller equal to 0.
2. The dragon battles the hero until the hp of the hero is smaller equal to 0.
3. The hero and the dragon have a set of "hit points", describing their lives remaining.
4. The hit points value is read from the user at the beginning.
5. The user also sets the maximum hit points an attack from each side can take away.
6. If the user is not putting readable inputs, then the game starts with the hardcoded numbers.
7. The game chooses a random number of the attack, hence lives that can be taken away from the dragon/hero.
8. The game ends when one character has no hit points (lives) left
